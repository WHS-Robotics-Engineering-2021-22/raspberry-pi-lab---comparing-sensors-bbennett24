### The actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environment would be the humidity sensor sensing the miosture in the air and sends a value between 1-100 to the code.
### Some of the environmental factors that would affect the sensors could be and intense amount of humity or heat, water like rain, altitude.
### Without the coding there would be no way to know what the reading is on the sensors.
